# langgen_class_project
This is a repository intended to store code artifacts related to my class project in using language models to handle enciphered text.
TEST addition!

Finally, please add a README that explains the main execution paths (commands, file/object
dependencies with a brief paragraph description) for the following:
1) data downloading / generation / preprocessing
2) training your baselines
3) training your experiments
4) evaluating your model output (scoring, sampling, etc)
